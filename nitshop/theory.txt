In React.js , a component is a piece of code that represents a part of a user interface.
It can be a class component or a functional component.
Class component is a js class that extends React.Component class , while a functionalcomponent is a js
funtion that returns only the React element.

A PureComponent is a special type of component that is similar to a component,
but with additional features 
or optimizations .When a component is a PureComponent,
React will do a shallow comparasion of the props and 
state before re-rendering the component.That means that if props and state 
have not changed, the component
will not be re-rendering . This can lead to a performance boost in some cases,
but if it's not used properly,
it can lead to unexpected behaviour.

Bottomline, a component is the most basic and most used for building
a block in React and PureComponent
is used whein it needs some special optimizations.

props(properties) is a way for manipulating data and states
We can send data through props and we can send
data to parent through props 


Parent component is component which is created
Child component is component which is included in Parent component
Parent component can have more than one child components
Child components can be also found in other components as children(prop)
Children as a prop is a reserved name
